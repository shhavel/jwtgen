# JWTGen [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/shhavel/jwtgen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/shhavel/jwtgen)

CLI for generating Json Web Tokens (JWT's)

CLI takes multiple key value pairs as input, and copy the generated JWT to your clipboard.

Required inputs are user_id and email. In addition, other key/value pairs can also be entered.

## Installation

    $ gem install jwtgen

## Dependencies

Check dependencies of [Ruby Clipboard](https://github.com/janlelis/clipboard/)

## Usage

Basic usage without encryption:

```sh
$ jwtgen --payload user_id=1234,email=ted.crilly@example.com
The JWT has been copied to your clipboard!
```

Provide HMAC algorithm and secret key:

```sh
$ jwtgen --key my$ecretK3y --algorithm HS512 \
    --payload user_id=9876,email=dougal.mcguire@example.com,first_name=Dougal,last_name=McGuire
The JWT has been copied to your clipboard!
```

## Development
